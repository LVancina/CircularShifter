# CircularShifter
This is my project from the first half of CS504, Software Design at Drexel University Online.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate mastery of a number of object oriented design patterns, including the Singleton, Wrapper, and Factory patterns.
I use a bubble sort for the alphabetizer class, which I know is brutally inefficient. I just haven't had a chance to go back and implement a better algorithm yet.
